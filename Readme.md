“Good [morning/afternoon], everyone,

I’m excited to introduce you to Manipal UniNav—a smart, intuitive university navigation app designed to simplify life on campus for students, faculty, and visitors alike.

Whether you're trying to find a lecture hall, a café, or your hostel building, Manipal UniNav helps you get there easily and efficiently. It offers accurate directions, estimated walking times, and interactive guidance—bringing clarity to what can often be a confusing first few weeks on a large campus.

🔧 Behind the Scenes:
The project is split into two core parts, each maintained in separate repositories and deployed individually:

The Interactive Map Module – This is the heart of the navigation experience. It uses maps sourced from OpenStreetMap and other open-source map providers, ensuring free and reliable access to detailed, customizable mapping data.

For real-time routing and pathfinding, we’ve integrated the OpenRouteService (ORS) API, which provides accurate walking directions and seamless navigation.

The Introductory Website Page – A clean, informative front-end interface that introduces the app’s purpose and usage. This acts as the landing page, with an embedded link that redirects users to the full interactive map experience.

🏫 Campus Division:
To make the navigation even more user-friendly, I've divided the university into two distinct zones:

The College Campus – housing academic blocks, libraries, labs, and administrative buildings.

The Hostel Campus – including student housing, mess areas, and nearby recreational spots.

This separation helps in organizing routes more efficiently and ensures users can easily toggle between academic and residential navigation.

🎯 Purpose & Impact:
Manipal UniNav is built with a simple vision: to help everyone on campus find their way without hassle—whether it's a new student figuring out where their next class is, or a visitor locating the auditorium. With open-source tools and thoughtful design, we’ve created a solution that’s light, fast, and scalable.

So, head over to mujnavigator.netlify.app to explore the interface, and click through to access the full map experience.

Thank you—and I hope you enjoy using UniNav as much as I enjoyed building it!”
